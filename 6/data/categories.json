Cypress tried to locate elements based on this query:\n\n> cy.get(input[name=\"0-2/city\"])\n\nWe initially found matching element(s), but while waiting for them to become actionable, they disappeared from the page. Common situations why this happens:\n  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously\n  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element\n\nYou can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:\n\n> `cy.get('button').click().click()`\n\nto\n\n> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`\n> `cy.get('@btn').click()`\n\nhttps://on.cypress.io/element-has-detached-from-dom","children":[{"name":"Validate successful submission of contact form - Fill in all required fields with Desired use case","uid":"4514b0b1e518e347","parentUid":"a39fe1b4a9e6d305b0706b2c9aea121b","status":"failed","time":{"start":1680814569228,"stop":1680814610015,"duration":40787},"flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":0,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[]}],"uid":"a39fe1b4a9e6d305b0706b2c9aea121b"},{"name":"Timed out retrying after 30000ms: expected '<label.hs-main-font-element>' to be 'visible'\n\nThis element `<label.hs-main-font-element>` is not visible because its ancestor has `position: fixed` CSS property and it is overflowed by other elements.
